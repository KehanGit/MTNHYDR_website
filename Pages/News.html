                <p>August 2020: Congratulations to Victoria for earning her masters! Read more about her masters work below.

                    </br>
                    Where can we use satellite sensors for observing snow? Where do they best "work"? For their Master's Thesis, Victoria Ly created a tool and set of maps to 
                    identify where in the world Passive Microwave (PM) sensors can retrieve Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) measurements. Using Google Earth Engine, the user can adjust 
                    a set of limitations that hinder PM accuracy (e.g. wet snow, deep snow, dense forest cover, and the combination of those factors). The goal is for a researcher 
                    or water manager to be able to look up their region of interest or watershed, and see if they can use PM-derived snow data at their locality. The tool and maps 
                    will be available online soon. Stay tuned!</p>

                <h1>Steven Earns NASA FINNEST Fellowship</h1>
                <p>August 2020: Steven earned the NASA FINNEST Fellowship award! His research project is described below. Congratulations!
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Uncertainty in the longwave (infrared) radiation balance at the snow surface limits our ability to model the timing and rate of snowmelt of seasonal mountain 
                    snow. Infrared remote sensing by satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) could provide estimates of snow-surface 
                    temperature (upward longwave) and cloud cover (a source of downward longwave) observations at sub-hourly intervals to decrease these uncertainties and evaluate 
                    model performance. This work will investigate how GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) observations can be used to: observe surface temperatures of seasonal snow 
                    in the mountains, detect periods of cloud cover and enhanced downward longwave radiation, and drive statistical downscaling ("sensor fusion") models to 
                    represent longwave energy fluxes at finer spatial resolutions.</p>

                <p>January 2020: Cassie Lumbrazo helped out at the CUAHSI Snow Measurement Field School this year in Bretton Woods, NH. This 4-day field school took place in the 
                    frigid White Mountains of New Hampshire where students gained fundamental training in snow measurement collection and analysis. From excavating snow pits to 
                    characterizing stratigraphy, many of the students will take what they learned at this field course and apply it during the 2020 NASA SnowEx field campaign this 
                    month!</p>
